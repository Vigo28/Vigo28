# Hi there 👋

I'm a HBO-ICT student from the Netherlands exploring the world of **Data Science, Analytics and AI**. I’m still finding my path in the data world, but I'm motivated, curious, and convinced that data & AI are a big part of the future, and I want to be part of that.

## 🧩 Projects

### **📌 Pattern Recognition for Healthcare**
A project for my studies where we built a **pattern recognition prototype** for the healthcare domain.  
- Limited test data prevented training a neural network  
- We designed a **rule-based system** as the best possible solution at the time  
- Learned a lot about data limitations, realistic model design, and problem-solving

*(More projects coming as I expand my experience in data science!)*
